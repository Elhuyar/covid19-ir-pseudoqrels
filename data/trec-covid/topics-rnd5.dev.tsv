34	coronavirus recovery	What are the longer-term complications of those who recover from COVID-19?	Seeking information on the health outcomes for those that recover from the virus. Excludes studies only focusing on adverse effects related to a particular COVID-19 drug.
42	Vitamin D and COVID-19	Does Vitamin D impact COVID-19 prevention and treatment?	This includes studies describing possible role of Vitamin D in prevention of COVID-19, suppression of cytokine storm, clinical outcomes, and associations between Vitamin D status and COVID-19 mortality.
7	serological tests for coronavirus	are there serological tests that detect antibodies to coronavirus?	Looking for assays that measure immune response to COVID-19 that will help determine past infection and subsequent possible immunity.
2	coronavirus response to weather changes	how does the coronavirus respond to changes in the weather	seeking range of information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus viability in different weather/climate conditions as well as information related to transmission of the virus in different climate conditions
6	coronavirus test rapid testing	what types of rapid testing for Covid-19 have been developed?	Looking for studies identifying ways to diagnose Covid-19 more rapidly.
23	coronavirus hypertension	what kinds of complications related to COVID-19 are associated with hypertension?	seeking specific outcomes that hypertensive  (any type) patients are more/less likely to face if infected with the virus
11	coronavirus hospital rationing	what are the guidelines for triaging patients infected with coronavirus?	Seeking information on any guidelines for prioritizing COVID-19 patients infected with coronavirus based on demographics, clinical signs, serology and other tests.
50	mRNA vaccine coronavirus	what is known about an mRNA vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 virus?	Looking for studies specifically focusing on mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, including how mRNA vaccines work, why they are promising, and any results from actual clinical studies.
14	coronavirus super spreaders	what evidence is there related to COVID-19 super spreaders	seeking range of information related to the number and proportion of super spreaders, their patterns of behavior that lead to spread, and potential prevention strategies targeted specifically toward super spreaders
49	post-infection COVID-19 immunity	do individuals who recover from COVID-19 show sufficient immune response, including antibody levels and T-cell mediated immunity, to prevent re-infection?	There is concern about re-infection for COVID-19, so this topic is looking for studies suggesting post-infection immunity, including post-infection antibody levels (over time) and evidence for individuals who have been infected more than once.
